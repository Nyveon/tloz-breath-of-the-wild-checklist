## Contribution

Feel free to report issues, suggest features or submit pull requests.

### Linting & Style

Linting for all files is done with [Prettier](https://prettier.io), if you are going submit a pull request I would appreciate if you could use it as well, to keep all the code consistent style-wise. Indentation is done with Tabs, not spaces. Depending on how you are using prettier, you will have to configure this. *If enough interest is shown in the project, I will add a pre-commit hook to enforce this, but for now it's just manual.*

### Folder structure

- `src` - Source files for the website. This is the only folder that should be edited
  - `css` - CSS files generated by Sass, **should not be edited manually**.
  - `data` - Data files used by Eleventy. JSON used by pages, and python files used to process/generate them.
  - `fonts` - Fonts.
  - `img` - Images and icons.
  - `includes` - Nunjucks templates used by other pages.
    - `base.njk` - The base template for all pages, includes the html for the head, header and footer.
  - `js` - JavaScript files.
  - `scss` - Sass files.
    - `base` - Base styles for the website (CSS resets, typography and common styles).
    - `components` - Styles for individual components (Checkboxes, quest cards, radios, etc.).
    - `layout` - Styles for the layout of the website (Header, footer, etc.).
    - `pages` - Page-specific styles.
    - `utilities` - Utility classes, variables and mixins (Colors, sizes, common functions).
  - `compendium.njk` - The compendium completion page.
  - `index.njk` - The homepage.
  - `other.njk` - The Misc counter and checklists page.
  - `quests.njk` - The quests cheklist.
- `docs` - The compiled website. This folder is generated by Eleventy and **should not be edited manually**. It is used to host the website on GitHub Pages.

### HTML

The websites HTML is generated using the [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) templating engine.

### JS

The website uses the [Alpine.js framework](https://alpinejs.dev) for UI interactivity, and the [persist plugin](https://alpinejs.dev/plugins/persist) for saving data locally.

### SASS/CSS

Keep in mind many styles have been reset with [sanitize.css](https://github.com/csstools/sanitize.css).

The rest are generated from the [Sass](https://sass-lang.com) files in the `src/scss` folder. The main file is `src/scss/main.scss`, which imports all the other files.

In order to use SASS, you will need to install the [Sass CLI](https://sass-lang.com/install). Once installed, you can run the following command to compile the SASS files to CSS:

```bash
sass --watch src/scss/main.scss:src/css/main.css
```

For vscode you can use the following configuration along with the LiveSass plugin:

```json
"liveSassCompile.settings.formats": [{
  "format": "compressed",
  "extensionName": ".css",
  "savePath": "/src/css"
}]
```

### Building the site

The website uses static site generator [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev). If you've not used it before, I recommend you read the [getting started guide](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/getting-started/). To build the site, run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

To run a local development server, and see changes as you edit the page run:

```bash
npm start
```
